# Governance

Ownership of tokens within the Oikos ecosystem is determined by a public network of BEP20 smart contracts. However the basic protocol design, incentive parameter settings, and system development are presently governed by the Oikos foundation. Although the foundation initially made this tradeoff between centralisation and speed of development, it is committed to further decentralising key decision-making processes in the system. Steps in this direction are being taken by the development of community-driven governance and development methodologies.

## Development Bounties

The code that runs Oikos is mostly [MIT licenced](https://github.com/oikos-cash/oikos/blob/master/LICENSE) and open source, and in principle anyone can contribute. To encourage this, the Oikos foundation has offered bounties for development and bug reports by parties outside of the core engineering team. Development bounties and discussion takes place in corresponding [GitHub issues](https://github.com/oikos-cash/oikos/issues).
